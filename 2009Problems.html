			<h3> PROBLEM #1:      THE FIFTH POWER</h3>
			<p> Background Information:	According to the Binomial Theorem: </p>
			<img src="2009p1.png" alt="problem1">
			<p> The coefficients of the monomial terms in the expansion of (x + y)<sup>5</sup> are the same as the values 
			on a corresponding row in Yang Hui’s Triangle.  Yang Hui’s Triangle can be computed by the 
			following method.</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Start with a row with a single 1 </li>
				<li> On successive rows, add the numbers directly above and to the left/right together to get 
				the new value.  If a number above in either direction doesn’t exist, substitute a zero for 
				that missing numbe	</li>

		<h3> PROBLEM #2:      Calendar Days</h3>
			<p> In the 2009 calendar year, we have 365 days spread over 12 
			months, from January 1st 2009, through December 31st 2009.  Your job is to convert from a 
			cardinal number representation of a date (1-01-2009) to a proper ordinal number representation.
			The rules for the proper suffixes for days are as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> If a number ends in 1, </li>
					<ul> 
						<li>If that number is a 1, 21, or 31, append a “st” to it.</li>
						<li>If that number is an 11, append a “th” to it.</li>
					</ul>
				<li> If a number ends in 2, </li>
					<ul> 
						<li>If that number is a 2 or a 22, append an “nd” to it.</li>
						<li>If that number is a 12, append a “th” to  it.</li>
					</ul>
				<li> If a number ends in 3,
					<ul> 
						<li>If that number is a 3 or 23, append a “rd” to it.</li>
						<li>If that number is a 13, append a “th” to it.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			<h4> Programming Problem:</h4>
				<p>Input:		Two positive integers representing valid month/day combinations for the
								year 2009.  The month is first, followed by the date.<br><br>
						Output:	The date, starting with the month, followed by the day as an ordinal 
								number, followed by the year 2009.  All values are separated by one space.<br><br>

				Example 1:	Input:	1   2<br>
						Output:	January 1st 2009<br><br>
	
				Example 2:	Input:	10   8<br>
						Output:	October 8th 2009<br><br>

				Example 3:	Input:	4   7<br>
						Output:	April 8th 2009<br><br>
				Example 4:	Input:	12   12<br>
						Output:	December 12th 2009<br>	<br>

		<h3> PROBLEM #3:	Reversing Strings </h3>
				<p><u>Background Information:</u>	A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sentence that reads the same 
				backwards and forwards. For example, the word “radar” is a palindrome. For this problem,
				you must write a program that reads a string of characters and prints whether or not the
				entire string is a palindrome. Your program should ignore all blanks, numbers, 
				punctuation and any other non-letter characters, and should be case insensitive
				(i.e., it should not care if characters are capital letters or small letters). 
				For example "5R3a dAr!" should be considered to be a palindrome. 
			</p>
			
			<h4> Programming Problem:</h4>
			<p>Input:		One string no greater than 100 characters.<br>
				Output:	“Yes” if the input string is a palindrome; “No” otherwise.<br><br>

				Example 1:	Input:	radar<br>
				Output:	Yes<br><br>
			
				Example 2:	Input:	radiar<br>
				Output:	No<br><br>

				Example 3:	Input:	Able was I ere I saw Elba!<br>
				Output:	No<br><br>

				Example 4:	Input: 	Han     258907=-=5748-087-48n123526537….ah256830<br>
				Output: 	Yes

		<h3> Problem #4:	Gray Codes </h3>
			<p>
				<u>Background Information:</u>	Frank Gray was a physicist and researcher at Bell Labs who was awarded many patents for his work related to televisions in the 1930’s and 1940’s.  He is also remembered as the inventor of the Gray code, or reflected binary code, which he patented in 1953 with relation to analog to digital conversion.  The Gray code is a binary numeral system often used in electronics, but with many applications in mathematics.<br><br>

				A Gray code is a way of representing binary integers such that successive values differ from each other in only one bit position.  To convert binary to Gray code, apply the exclusive or operator bit by bit to the binary value and a right-shifted version of itself, for example:<br><br>
				</p>
				<img style = "margin-left: 28%;" src = "2009p4.png"></img>
				<p>
				A right-shifted binary number is one where all the bits have been moved to the right one binary place, with a zero moving into the leftmost binary place and the original rightmost bit disappearing.  Gray codes can be produced for N bits.  The table below is a four-bit Gray code.  Gray codes of 4 bits are more are not unique.<br>

		<h3> Problem #5:	Penalty Box </h3>
			<p>
				<u>Background Information:</u>	In the sport of hockey, each team has their own penalty box.
				When a player commits an infraction, they are sent to their team's penalty box for 
				either 2, 5, or 10 minutes, depending on the severity of their infraction.  Immediately after
				serving the allotted time, the player is released and let back onto the ice.  
				Often in penalty-filled contests, penalty boxes can become quite full due to many players 
				being sent to the penalty box in a short span of time.<br><br>

				During the  offseason, a statistically-minded fan decided to try to determine the most players
				that could have been in either team's penalty boxes during each game from the previous season
				(the most in any one penalty box at a time, not in both).  He managed to convert the box
				scores from each game, which summarize a game's scoring and penalties, into a format that 
				lists how many penalties were assessed in a game, and for each penalty, which team it was 
				on (the home team or visiting team), how long it was for (2, 5, or 10 minutes), and when
				it was issued.  Unfortunately, his conversion scrambled the order of the penalties so they 
				no longer are listed in chronological order!  He's asked for your help to write a program
				to read in his descriptions of a game's penalties and determine the maximum number of 
				players that could have been in any one penalty box during that game.<br><br>

				In writing your program, you may ignore any issues regarding the physical size of the 
				penalty boxes or the actual number of players on either team; the penalty boxes are large 
				enough to fit any number of players, and there are at least as many players on each team 
				as there are penalties assessed to that team.  Finally, you may make no assumptions about 
				the length of a game due to the possibility of overtimes to settle tie games.<br><br>
				</p>
				
				<h4> Programming Problem:</h4>
				
				<p>Input:		The input begins with a single integer N representing the number of games 
				you are to process.  What follows are the descriptions of the penalties for N games.<br>
				Each game description begins with an integer M on its own line describing how 
				many penalties were assessed during that game.  M lines follow, each describing
				one penalty in the following format:<br>
				<Strong>C L T</Strong><br>
				Where <strong>C</strong> is a single character, 'h' or 'v', describing 
				which team the penalty is on.  <strong>L</strong> is an integer describing the penalty length 
				(2, 5, or 10).  <strong>T</strong> is an integer describing the time that the penalty occurred
				as the number of seconds elapsed since the start of the game when the penalty was called.<br><br>
				Output:	For each game, output a single number on its own line that represents the maximum
				number of players in either team's penalty box.<br><br>
				Sample Input:<br>
				3 <br> 2 <br> h 2 0 <br> a 2 0 <br> 3 <br> h 10 60 <br> a 2 0 <br> h 2 0 <br>
				3 <br> h 10 120 <br> a 20 <br> h 20 <br><br>
				Sample output:<br>
				1 <br> 2 <br> 1
